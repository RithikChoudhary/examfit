      "title": "Bonn Climate Change Conference",
      "content": "The Bonn Climate Change Conference is a very important annual event under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This conference serves as an essential platform for climate negotiations and discussions. The 2025 conference commenced on June 16 and will conclude on June 26. Over 5,000 representatives from governments, Indigenous groups, international organisations, scientists, and civil society are participating. This years agenda includes discussions on financing climate action and the Global Goal on Adaptation. The Bonn Climate Change Conference is an annual mid-year meeting. It is formally known as the Sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBs). The conference plays important role in shaping the agenda for the annual Conference of the Parties (COP). The COP occurs every November and focuses on broader climate agreements. The primary aim of the conference is to discuss technical and scientific aspects of climate negotiations. It sets the groundwork for the COP. Outcomes from Bonn influence decisions made at the COP. Recommendations from the SBs often appear in the final agreements made during the COP sessions. The conference is led by the SBs of the UNFCCC. The two main SBs are the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA). The SBI focuses on assessing and reviewing the implementation of decisions. It also supports financial and technical discussions for developing countries. The SBSTA provides scientific advice and connects scientific findings with policymakers. A crucial topic this year is the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). The GGA aims to establish a common global objective for adaptation, similar to the mitigation goal of limiting temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Although the GGA was introduced in the Paris Agreement in 2015, substantial progress occurred only at COP28 in Dubai, where a framework for defining global adaptation goals was adopted.",

      "title": "Common Board Recommendation for Indian Education System",
      "content": "The Ministry of Education recommended that seven states of India adopt a common board for classes 10 and 12. This suggestion follows an analysis by the School Education Department. The analysis revealed that these states accounted for 66 per cent of student failures in the previous academic year. The seven states identified are Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Kerala, Manipur, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal. India has 66 school examination boards. This includes three national-level boards and 63 state-level boards. Among these, the top 33 boards cater to 97 per cent of students. The remaining 33 boards serve only 3 per cent. The disparity in board performance is . The recommendation for a common board aims to improve academic outcomes. In 2024, around 22.17 lakh students failed Class 10. Additionally, 20.16 lakh students failed Class 12. Although these numbers have improved over the decade, they remain a barrier to higher education transition. The analysis marks the need for a standardised assessment process across boards. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) plays important role in engaging unsuccessful students. Its influence is currently strong in Delhi, Rajasthan, and Haryana. The Ministry suggests expanding NIOSs prominence to states with higher failure rates. This step is essential for reducing dropout rates. The analysis indicates that girls are outperforming boys in most boards, particularly in science subjects. Over 28 lakh girls passed in science, surpassing the 27.2 lakh who passed in arts. This marks shift from previous trends.",

      "title": "EU Proposes Ban on Russian Gas Imports by 2027",
      "content": "The European Commission has recently proposed a legally binding ban on the import of Russian gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 2027. This decision follows the EUs commitment to sever its longstanding energy ties with Russia, a move prompted by the geopolitical tensions arising from Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The proposal aims to ensure that EU member states cannot block the ban, particularly Hungary and Slovakia, which have expressed opposition. The ban will be implemented in stages. Starting from January 1, 2026, all new Russian gas and LNG contracts signed in 2025 will be prohibited. Short-term contracts, defined as those lasting less than one year and signed before June 17, 2025, will face a ban from June 17, 2026. The final phase will see a prohibition on existing long-term contracts beginning January 1, 2028, effectively ending the EUs reliance on Russian gas. The Commission has crafted the ban using EU trade and energy law, allowing it to pass with a reinforced majority rather than requiring unanimous approval. This strategy aims to circumvent potential vetoes from Hungary and Slovakia. The legal measures will also permit companies to invoke force majeure clauses in their contracts, enabling them to exit agreements due to unforeseen circumstances. Hungary and Slovakia, which still import amounts of Russian gas, have raised concerns about rising energy costs associated with the transition. These countries have vowed to block sanctions requiring unanimous consent. However, the Commissions proposal ensures that they will have until January 1, 2028, to phase out their imports, including short-term contracts. As the EU moves to replace Russian gas supplies, it is exploring alternative energy sources. The EU has the capacity to import 250 billion cubic metres of LNG annually, although it utilised less than half of this last year. The bloc is likely to increase imports from the United States, responding to pressures from US leadership. Countries like Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France have expressed their support for the ban, indicating that they are ready to transition to non-Russian sources.",

      "title": "International Day Against Unilateral Coercive Measures",
      "content": "Recently, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution designating December 4 as the International Day Against Unilateral Coercive Measures. This resolution was passed with 116 votes in favour, 51 against, and 6 abstentions. It aims to raise global awareness about the adverse effects of unilateral economic, financial, and trade sanctions that contravene international law and the UN Charter. The initiative puts stress on the need for international cooperation and solidarity, particularly for developing nations impacted by these measures. The resolution was introduced as a response to the increasing prevalence of unilateral sanctions imposed by various nations, particularly those from the Global North. It marks the detrimental effects of these sanctions on economic and social development, especially in developing countries. The resolution seeks to promote a collective approach to international relations, urging states to refrain from unilateral actions that violate established legal norms. The resolution received broad support from 116 countries, reflecting majority. However, it faced opposition from 51 countries, including prominent Western nations such as the United States and members of the European Union. Six countries, including Bahamas and Türkiye, abstained from voting. This voting outcome illustrates a division between developing nations advocating for the resolution and developed nations defending the legitimacy of sanctions. Countries like Eritrea and Zimbabwe voiced strong opposition to unilateral sanctions. Eritrea described these measures as tools of political and economic compulsion, emphasising their harmful impact on civilians. Zimbabwe brought into light its prolonged experience with sanctions, which have stunted its economic growth. In contrast, the European Union and the United States defended sanctions as necessary tools to uphold international law and combat issues such as terrorism and human rights abuses, arguing that their measures are targeted and aim to minimise humanitarian harm. The primary objective of the International Day Against Unilateral Coercive Measures is to raise awareness of the harmful effects of these sanctions. The resolution aims to reaffirm international legal norms and promote the sovereignty of nations. It seeks to encourage global solidarity, particularly among developing countries that bear the brunt of unilateral measures. The establishment of this day is also consistent with Article 41 of the UN Charter, which limits the application of economic measures to those sanctioned by the Security Council.",

      "content": "Indias position in the global Energy Transition Index has shifted to 71st in 2025. This ranking was released by the World Economic Forum, which assesses the energy transition performance of 118 countries. Despite a drop from 63rd last year, alongside China, has shown improvements in energy access and transition readiness. Sweden leads the Energy Transition Index, followed by Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland. Other notable rankings include China at 12th and the United States at 17th. Pakistan ranks 101st, while Congo holds the last position. The top five economies play important role in shaping global energy transitions due to their substantial share of global GDP, population, and emissions. India has made considerable advancements in energy equity. Increased access to energy and clean fuels has been a priority. The country has also improved energy regulations and invested in renewable technologies. These efforts have been essential in enhancing energy security and equity. The World Economic Forum marks several factors influencing Indias ranking. Improvements in grid reliability and energy access in rural areas are vital. Reducing reliance on imported energy is also crucial for enhancing energy security. Continued investments in infrastructure and renewable energy are necessary for further progress.

      "content": "वैश्विक मुद्रा व्यवस्था में बदलाव की कोशिशों के तहत चीन ने अमेरिकी डॉलर पर निर्भरता को कम करने और रेनमिन्बी (RMB) को बहु-मुद्रा प्रणाली (multi-currency system) का एक मजबूत विकल्प बनाने की अपनी रणनीति को तेज कर दिया है। हाल ही में शंघाई में आयोजित Lujiazui Forum में चीन के केंद्रीय बैंक (Peoples Bank of China) के गवर्नर पैन गोंगशेंग ने इस दिशा में कई महत्त्वपूर्ण बातें कही हैं। पैन ने कहा कि वैश्विक वित्तीय प्रणाली अब एक ऐसी संरचना की ओर बढ़ रही है जिसमें कई संप्रभु मुद्राएं समानांतर रूप से मौजूद हों और एक-दूसरे को संतुलित करें। उन्होंने एकल मुद्रा (डॉलर) पर अत्यधिक निर्भरता को व्यवस्थागत जोखिम और वैश्विक वित्तीय अस्थिरता का स्रोत बताया। उन्होंने रेनमिन्बी की बढ़ती भूमिका की ओर इशारा किया, जो अब व्यापार वित्त में दूसरी और वैश्विक भुगतान में तीसरी सबसे बड़ी मुद्रा बन गई है। 2008 की वैश्विक मंदी के बाद से चीन ने अपनी मुद्रा को वैश्विक व्यापार में अधिक उपयोगी बनाने की दिशा में ठोस प्रयास किए हैं। विशेष रूप से एशिया और विकासशील देशों के साथ व्यापारिक संबंधों में रेनमिन्बी का उपयोग बढ़ा है। चीन डिजिटल भुगतान तकनीक, विशेष रूप से Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) का उपयोग कर डॉलर-आधारित अवसंरचना को पुराना बताते हुए उससे बाहर निकलने की दिशा में काम कर रहा है। इसका उद्देश्य तेज, सस्ता और अधिक स्वायत्त भुगतान नेटवर्क तैयार करना है। इन समस्याओं को दूर करने के लिए चीन Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) योजना का विस्तार कर रहा है, जिससे घरेलू निवेशकों को विदेशी संपत्तियों में निवेश की अनुमति मिले।",

      "content": "The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) released comprehensive guidelines for the disposal of expired and unused drugs. This initiative aims to mitigate the ecological risks associated with improper drug disposal. The guidelines encourage state and Union Territory drug controllers to promote adherence among stakeholders. The guidelines stem from a 2018 study by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The study identified environmental hazards from expired drugs disposed of in landfills. In 2019, the Centre for Science and Environment brought into light poor disposal practices in the Delhi-National Capital Region. These issues prompted calls for drug take-back initiatives and better accountability for drug manufacturers. The guidelines outline several disposal methods. These include encapsulation, inertisation, and incineration. Additionally, a Flush List identifies 17 specific drugs that can be safely flushed to prevent environmental contamination. EPR is a central theme in the guidelines. It holds manufacturers accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products. This includes the safe disposal of unused medicines. Effective EPR requires consumer participation and reverse logistics for returning products. The guidelines specify responsibilities within the supply chain. Retailers must return expired stock to suppliers. Wholesalers and distributors are required to accept unused drugs for proper disposal. Manufacturers must accept returns from retailers and wholesalers.",

      "title": "Helicopter Safety Issues in Uttarakhands Char Dham",
      "content": "Recently, a tragic helicopter crash in Uttarakhand resulted in the deaths of five passengers and the pilot. This incident has drawn attention to the safety of helicopter operations during the Char Dham pilgrimage season. Helicopter rides in this region are already under scrutiny due to challenging terrain and unpredictable weather patterns. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has been monitoring private operators closely, especially after a series of accidents. The DGCA oversees aviation regulations in India. However, the Uttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority (UCADA) coordinates helicopter operations in the state. UCADA was established in 2013 to manage air traffic and safety. They set rules for operators, including landing fees and the number of flights. Despite these regulations, the absence of an Air Traffic Control system in the Kedarnath area raises concerns about safety. Helicopter operations in the Char Dham region face numerous challenges. The Kedarnath helipad is situated at a high altitude of 11,000 feet. Seasonal shuttle services operate primarily between May and June and September to October. Operators are pressured to maximise flights due to high landing fees and strict regulations. This pressure can lead to unsafe flying practices, particularly in adverse weather conditions. Experts have pointed out that the flawed revenue model contributes to safety issues. High landing charges and penalties for not meeting flight quotas incentivise risky behaviour among operators. Recommendations from the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau for improved navigational aids and an ATC facility remain unaddressed. The lack of a qualified meteorological facility further complicates safe flying. To operate in the Char Dham circuit, pilots must have extensive training and experience. They need knowledge of the terrain, seasonal weather conditions, and emergency procedures. However, the current regulations allow only a limited number of helicopters in the Kedarnath valley at any one time. This restriction aims to reduce congestion but may not be sufficient to ensure safety.",
