The description has been found from various travelogues from India and abroad. The position of Chandraketugarh has been acknowledged on the basis of Maritime-Land route memoirs and textual historic evidences obtained from within India and also from the eastern and western parts of Asia. The antiquity of the area dates back to eras as early as 4th century BCE, a period much prior to the Mauryan era and shows evidence in the continuity of subsequent Sunga, Kushana, Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasties.\r\n\r\nPair 2 is correctly matched: Inamgaon is a chalcolithic site in Maharashtra. After the disintegration of the Indus civilization, in a phase known as the Early Jorwe (1400– 1000 BC), hundreds of agrarian villages flourished in the Deccan region of west-central India. Environmental degradation, combined with unsustainable agricultural practices, contributed to the abandonment of many communities around 1000 BC. Inamgaon was one of a handful of villages to persist into the Late Jorwe phase (1000–700 BC), wherein reliance on dry-plough agricultural production declined.\r\n\r\nunnamed 51\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPair 3 is correctly matched : Mangadu is a Megalithic Site in Kerala. The megalithic monuments at Mangadu consisted of 28 hard compact and unhewn laterite blocks within an area of 5 cents of land. The pottery at Mangadu can be classified into three categories namely the huge urns, the medium sized jars are hand made. The associated potteries are of wheel-made pottery and the fabric is black and red and red wares.\r\n\r\nPair 4 is incorrectly matched : Salihundam is a Buddhist Site in Andhra Pradesh as early as the 2nd century CE to the 12th century CE. Here, Buddhism flourished under the patronage of various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, and the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The archaeological excavations have revealed numerous stupas, chaityas, viharas and a congregation hall, indicating the importance of this site in the transmission of Buddhist knowledge and wisdom.

Chidambaram Pillai’s venture into a national shipbuilding enterprise – Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company – at Tuticorin, however, gave a challenge to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company.\r\nThere had been a consciousness even in the 1890s that Indian products should be encouraged in the face of the onslaught of imported foreign goods. To this effect, several leaders had been organising melas (fairs) to exhibit Indian handicrafts and putting up stores for their sale so that their production could be encouraged:\r\nRabindranath’s Swadeshi Bhandar (1897)\r\nJogeshchandra Chaudhuri’s Indian Stores (1901)\r\nSarala Debi’s Lakshmi Bhandar (1903)\r\nThe Bengal Chemicals factory was established by Prafullachandra Ray in 1893."

The Ottomans ousted the Portuguese from the Red Sea and dispatched a fleet to aid Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Rumi Khan, an Ottoman commander, successfully repelled Portuguese attacks on Daman and Diu in 1531. However, a larger threat emerged\r\nfrom the Mughals, leading Bahadur Shah to grant Bassein to the Portuguese. As part of the defensiveoffensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese\r\nwere granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat.\r\n\r\nKrishna’s Explanation:\r\nThe Portuguese had already mounted a clear and strategic presence in Mumbai long before the arrival of the British in India. After its takeover of Goa in 1510, the maritime power set about consolidating its presence in north Konkan, attempting several incursions on the islands of Bombay and Mahim,\r\ngoverned at the time by the Sultans of Gujarat. In 1526, the Portuguese established a factory at Bassein. In 1528-29 they seized the fort of Mahim. With the\r\nlargest fleet at their command, the Portuguese under Goa’s Viceroy Nuno da Cunha had become a nagging maritime presence for Sultan Bahadur Shah of\r\nGujarat. Wary of the growing power of the Mughals, Bahadur Shah chose to strike up an alliance with the Portuguese. In 1534 he signed off the seven islands of Bombay and the strategic town of Bassein to the Portuguese in a treaty of peace and commerce, bringing to an end Islamic rule on the Islands. Also, as a part of the defensive-offensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese were granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat."

Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy.\r\nHowever, the federation never came into being as the princely states did not join it.\r\nIt abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres.\r\nMoreover, the Act introduced responsible governments in provinces, that is, the governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in 1937 and was discontinued in 1939.\r\nIt provided for the adoption of dyarchy at the Centre.\r\nConsequently, the federal subjects were divided into reserved subjects and transferred subjects.\r\nHowever, this provision of the Act did not come into operation at all.\r\nIt introduced bicameralism in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of Bengal, Bombay, Madras, Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces were made bicameral consisting of a legislative council (upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house).\r\nIt extended the principle of separate electorates for depressed classes (scheduled castes), women and labour (workers).\r\nIt abolished the Council of India, established by the Government of India Act of 1858. The secretary of state for India was provided with a team of advisors.\r\nExtended franchise: About 10 per cent of the total population got the voting right.\r\nIt provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to control the currency and credit of the country.\r\nIt provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service Commission but also a Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service Commission for two or more provinces."

During that time the Gupta empire was restricted to Magadha only. Pushyabhuti of Thanesar (Haryana) also carved an independent state around that time.

About Ashoka’s Dhamma: Ashoka’s dhamma did not involve worship of a god, or performance of a sacrifice. He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Ashoka appointed representatives, referred to as the dhamma mahamatta, who travelled  around  instructing  people  about dhamma. Ashoka had his messages inscribed on pillars and rocks, and he ordered his officials to read his messages to people who were unable to do so for themselves.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a direct question from Class 6 NCERT Our Past 1, hence reading NCERT is very important both in terms of clearing concepts and gaining facts."

He was a Sanskrit Grammarian known for writing Ashtadhyayi- a sutra style treatise on Sanskrit grammar.\r\n\r\nPushyamitra Shunga started the Shunga dynasty by assassinating Brihadratha, the last ruler of the Magadha Empire in 185 BCE. Pushyamitra Sunga was a Buddhist follower. Some historians have portrayed him as anti Buddhist, but there is no credible evidence for the claim. He also constructed a stone gateway at Sanchi and restored Buddhist stupas at Barhut. He also patronized the Sanskrit grammar scholar Patanjali.\r\n\r\nAmarasimha was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet who lived in ancient India. Amarasimha was one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya, and according to the accounts of Hieun Tsang it is believed that he was the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished around 375 CE. Amarsimha is famous for his Sanskrit thesaurus- Amarakosha.\r\n\r\nKalidasa was a renowned Classical Sanskrit writer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets and dramatists in Indian history. He generally draws inspiration from the Vedas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas for his plays and poems. Kalidasa wrote three plays: Malavikagnimitram, Abhijnanasakuntalam, and Vikramorvasiyam.\r\n\r\nTwo epic poems of Kalidasa are Raghuvamsa and Kumarasambhava.

The Indian textile industries suffered as a result of them being less expensive than Indian textiles.\r\nFollowing the Industrial Revolution, Britain began making textiles by a machine that were considerably more affordable and of higher quality than conventional Indian textile.\r\nThe start of the industrial revolution had a negative impact on the Indian handicraft in India.\r\nAdditionally, the decline of the kings, chieftains, and zamindars who served as the employers of these masters of handicrafts led to the steady expansion of British dominion in India through outright battles with the rulers, which resulted in the suffering of handicrafts in India.\r\nIndia became both a raw material supplier and a finished goods market.

We also know that viceroy rejected commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev to a life sentence, which was criticised by several leaders.
