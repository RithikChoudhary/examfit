The description has been found from various travelogues from India and abroad. The position of Chandraketugarh has been acknowledged on the basis of Maritime-Land route memoirs and textual historic evidences obtained from within India and also from the eastern and western parts of Asia. The antiquity of the area dates back to eras as early as 4th century BCE, a period much prior to the Mauryan era and shows evidence in the continuity of subsequent Sunga, Kushana, Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasties.\n\nPair 2 is correctly matched: Inamgaon is a chalcolithic site in Maharashtra. After the disintegration of the Indus civilization, in a phase known as the Early Jorwe (1400– 1000 BC), hundreds of agrarian villages flourished in the Deccan region of west-central India. Environmental degradation, combined with unsustainable agricultural practices, contributed to the abandonment of many communities around 1000 BC. Inamgaon was one of a handful of villages to persist into the Late Jorwe phase (1000–700 BC), wherein reliance on dry-plough agricultural production declined.\n\nunnamed 51\n\n \n\nPair 3 is correctly matched : Mangadu is a Megalithic Site in Kerala. The megalithic monuments at Mangadu consisted of 28 hard compact and unhewn laterite blocks within an area of 5 cents of land. The pottery at Mangadu can be classified into three categories namely the huge urns, the medium sized jars are hand made. The associated potteries are of wheel-made pottery and the fabric is black and red and red wares.\n\nPair 4 is incorrectly matched : Salihundam is a Buddhist Site in Andhra Pradesh as early as the 2nd century CE to the 12th century CE. Here, Buddhism flourished under the patronage of various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Ikshvakus, and the Eastern Ganga dynasty. The archaeological excavations have revealed numerous stupas, chaityas, viharas and a congregation hall, indicating the importance of this site in the transmission of Buddhist knowledge and wisdom.

The Ottomans ousted the Portuguese from the Red Sea and dispatched a fleet to aid Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Rumi Khan, an Ottoman commander, successfully repelled Portuguese attacks on Daman and Diu in 1531. However, a larger threat emerged\r\nfrom the Mughals, leading Bahadur Shah to grant Bassein to the Portuguese. As part of the defensiveoffensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese\r\nwere granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat.\r\n\r\nKrishna’s Explanation:\r\nThe Portuguese had already mounted a clear and strategic presence in Mumbai long before the arrival of the British in India. After its takeover of Goa in 1510, the maritime power set about consolidating its presence in north Konkan, attempting several incursions on the islands of Bombay and Mahim,\r\ngoverned at the time by the Sultans of Gujarat. In 1526, the Portuguese established a factory at Bassein. In 1528-29 they seized the fort of Mahim. With the\r\nlargest fleet at their command, the Portuguese under Goa’s Viceroy Nuno da Cunha had become a nagging maritime presence for Sultan Bahadur Shah of\r\nGujarat. Wary of the growing power of the Mughals, Bahadur Shah chose to strike up an alliance with the Portuguese. In 1534 he signed off the seven islands of Bombay and the strategic town of Bassein to the Portuguese in a treaty of peace and commerce, bringing to an end Islamic rule on the Islands. Also, as a part of the defensive-offensive alliance against the Mughals, the Portuguese were granted permission to construct a fort at Diu, thereby solidifying their presence in Gujarat."

Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy.\r\nHowever, the federation never came into being as the princely states did not join it.\r\nIt abolished dyarchy in the provinces and introduced ‘provincial autonomy’ in its place. The provinces were allowed to act as autonomous units of administration in their defined spheres.\r\nMoreover, the Act introduced responsible governments in provinces, that is, the governor was required to act with the advice of ministers responsible to the provincial legislature. This came into effect in 1937 and was discontinued in 1939.\r\nIt provided for the adoption of dyarchy at the Centre.\r\nConsequently, the federal subjects were divided into reserved subjects and transferred subjects.\r\nHowever, this provision of the Act did not come into operation at all.\r\nIt introduced bicameralism in six out of eleven provinces. Thus, the legislatures of Bengal, Bombay, Madras, Bihar, Assam and the United Provinces were made bicameral consisting of a legislative council (upper house) and a legislative assembly (lower house).\r\nIt extended the principle of separate electorates for depressed classes (scheduled castes), women and labour (workers).\r\nIt abolished the Council of India, established by the Government of India Act of 1858. The secretary of state for India was provided with a team of advisors.\r\nExtended franchise: About 10 per cent of the total population got the voting right.\r\nIt provided for the establishment of a Reserve Bank of India to control the currency and credit of the country.\r\nIt provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service Commission but also a Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service Commission for two or more provinces."

During the 10th CE, Tomars of Delhi, Chauhans of Rajasthan, Solankis of Gujarat, Parmars of Malwa, Chandels of Bundelkhand started ruling north India. During the 14th CE, the Yadavas of Devagiri (Maharashtra) became an important ruling dynasty of Deccan. By eliminating options 2 and 5, we can get the correct answer.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If we try to apply knowledge of Physical geography here, we can try to attempt this otherwise difficult and complex question. Question is talking about “Northern India”. We all know Malwa (Malwa plateau) is located in central India (option 2) and Devagiri in Deccan (Devgiri Fort) (option 5). If we take calculable risk of elimination of both of these statements, we can reach the correct answer."

He felt that just as a father tries to teach his children, he had a duty to instruct his subjects. He was also inspired by the teachings of the Buddha. People in the empire followed different religions, and this sometimes led to conflict. Ashoka appointed representatives, referred to as the dhamma mahamatta, who travelled  around  instructing  people  about dhamma. Ashoka had his messages inscribed on pillars and rocks, and he ordered his officials to read his messages to people who were unable to do so for themselves.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a direct question from Class 6 NCERT Our Past 1, hence reading NCERT is very important both in terms of clearing concepts and gaining facts."

He was a Sanskrit Grammarian known for writing Ashtadhyayi- a sutra style treatise on Sanskrit grammar.\r\n\r\nPushyamitra Shunga started the Shunga dynasty by assassinating Brihadratha, the last ruler of the Magadha Empire in 185 BCE. Pushyamitra Sunga was a Buddhist follower. Some historians have portrayed him as anti Buddhist, but there is no credible evidence for the claim. He also constructed a stone gateway at Sanchi and restored Buddhist stupas at Barhut. He also patronized the Sanskrit grammar scholar Patanjali.\r\n\r\nAmarasimha was a Sanskrit grammarian and poet who lived in ancient India. Amarasimha was one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya, and according to the accounts of Hieun Tsang it is believed that he was the Chandragupta Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) who flourished around 375 CE. Amarsimha is famous for his Sanskrit thesaurus- Amarakosha.\r\n\r\nKalidasa was a renowned Classical Sanskrit writer who is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets and dramatists in Indian history. He generally draws inspiration from the Vedas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas for his plays and poems. Kalidasa wrote three plays: Malavikagnimitram, Abhijnanasakuntalam, and Vikramorvasiyam.\r\n\r\nTwo epic poems of Kalidasa are Raghuvamsa and Kumarasambhava. Kalidasa and Amarsimha were among the nine jewels of Chandragupta-II aka Chandragupta Vikramaditya."

The Indian textile industries suffered as a result of them being less expensive than Indian textiles.\r\nFollowing the Industrial Revolution, Britain began making textiles by a machine that were considerably more affordable and of higher quality than conventional Indian textile.\r\nThe start of the industrial revolution had a negative impact on the Indian handicraft in India.\r\nAdditionally, the decline of the kings, chieftains, and zamindars who served as the employers of these masters of handicrafts led to the steady expansion of British dominion in India through outright battles with the rulers, which resulted in the suffering of handicrafts in India.\r\nIndia became both a raw material supplier and a finished goods market.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The demand for a public enquiry of excesses committed by police during the civil disobedience movement was rejected by the Viceroy.\r\nStatement 4 is correct: Release of all political prisoners, except those guilty of violence was also agreed.\r\nNOTE: if we read Ncert, statement 1 is general and common. Securing participation by the Indian National Congress in the Second Round Table Conference was an important agenda of pact inter-alia. We also know that viceroy rejected commutation of the death sentence of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev to a life sentence, which was criticised by several leaders. This underlines that prisoners with violence charges were not released. This reasoning makes statement 4 correct. Option (b) i.e 1, 2 and 4 only is the only option with statement 1 and 4 in it !!"

It is a poem woven around a Yaksha, a subject of Lord\r\nKubera.\r\n It tells the story of a yaksa (or nature spirit) who was banished by his master to a far away place for\r\na year and begged a cloud to deliver a message of love to his wife.\r\nPair 4 is correct\r\n• Bharavi is well-known for Kiratarjuniya, composed around 550 CE.\r\n• Kirat is Shiva, who speaks to Arjuna as a mountain dwelling hunter.\r\n• This epic style kavya is considered one the greatest works in Sanskrit, celebrated for the complexity of\r\nthe language."

However, there was more expansion of the agrarian\r\neconomy.\r\n• There was more emphasis on Brahmanism and more instances of Vedic sacrifices by kings.\r\n• The culture of Megaliths paved the way for temple construction.\r\n• Sanskrit became the official language of the peninsula and most charters were prepared.\r\nOption 1 is correct\r\n• On the ruins of the Satavahanas, in the eastern part of the peninsula (especially in the Krishna−Guntur\r\nregion), arose the Ikshvakus.\r\n• The Ikshvakus were supplanted by the Pallavas.\r\n• The term Pallava means ‘creeper’, which is a Sanskrit version of the word tondi and in Tamil they are\r\nsynonymous to robber.\r\n• So, the Pallavas were probably a pastoral local tribe who established their authority in the land of\r\ncreepers called Tondaimandalam (the land between the north Penner and north Vellar rivers), mostly\r\ncomprising southern Andhra Pradesh and northern Tamil Nadu with their capital at Kanchi.\r\n• Kanchi (modern Kanchipuram), under them, became an important temple town and a centre of trade\r\nand commerce.\r\n• Some inscriptions refer to early kings of this dynasty, such as Shivaskandavarman, who probably ruled\r\nin the early 4th century CE.\r\n• But in the last quarter of the 6th century, Simhavishnu was the ruler who played a crucial role in the\r\nPallavas’ rise to power.\r\nOption 3 is correct\r\n• The Vakatakas were followed by the Chalukyas of Badami, who played a prominent role in the history\r\nof Deccan and south India for about two hundred years from the beginning of the 6th century CE.\r\n• The Chalukyas were a maritime power, and they set up their kingdom in western Deccan with the capital\r\nat Vatapi (modern Badami in Karnataka).\r\n• Along with the Chalukyas of Badami (who are primarily called the Western Chalukyas), there were two\r\nother branches of the lineage who ruled independently — the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi and the\r\nChalukyas of Lata.\r\n• The Western Chalukyas, in order to acquire legitimacy and respectability, claimed Brahmanical origin as\r\nHaritiputras of the Manavya gotra.\r\nOption 4 correct\r\n• The Pandyas were involved in internecine wars with the other contemporary powers such as the Pallavas.\r\n• They were in control of Madurai and Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu.\r\n• There is not enough information about the Pandyas of the early medieval times.\r\nOptions 2 and 5 are not correct\r\n• The first historical Phase in southern India belongs to c. 200 BCE−300 CE\r\n• The major kingdoms were the Satavahanas, the Cholas, the Cheras, and the Pandyas.\r\n• This period was marked by the appearance of numerous crafts, internal and external trade, widespread\r\nuse of coins and a good number of towns.\r\n• This period offered patronage to Buddhism as is evident in extensive Buddhist monuments in both\r\nAndhra and Maharashtra.\r\n• The Cave inscriptions also point to the existence of Jainism and Buddhism in the southern districts of\r\nTamil Nadu.\r\n• The epigraphs were mostly written in Prakrit."

The presence\r\nof megalithic structures, burial practices, and a broader range of associated artifacts provide a more comprehensive picture of the Megalithic culture.\r\n• Distinguishing Features:\r\no Monumental Architecture: Megaliths (structures made of large stones) are the hallmark of this culture.\r\nThese include:\r\n Dolmens: Chamber tombs with a capstone supported by vertical slabs.\r\n Menhirs: Upright standing stones, possibly serving as commemorative markers.\r\n Cairns: Heaps of stones, often marking communal burial sites.\r\n• Urns: Earthenware vessels for cremated remains.\r\n• Material Culture: Beyond BRW pottery, other artifacts shed light on their lives:\r\n• Microliths: Small stone tools used for hunting, scraping, and other activities.\r\n• Metal tools: Evidence suggests use of copper and iron tools later in the period.\r\n• Terracotta figurines: Depictions of human and animal figures offer insights into their beliefs and artistic\r\nexpression.\r\n• Geographical Distribution: Primarily concentrated in the Deccan Plateau (covering parts of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Maharashtra), Megalithic sites are also found in Kerala and\r\nparts of eastern and central India."

Murugan was revered as the god of war, victory, and wisdom in Tamil culture.\r\n• His connection to Kurinji reflects the spiritual significance attributed to the region's rugged and untamed\r\nlandscapes.\r\n• The primary occupation of the inhabitants of Kurinji was hunting and honey collection. The hilly terrain\r\nprovided abundant opportunities for hunting wild animals and gathering honey from natural beehives\r\nnestled within the rocky outcrops. These activities were essential for sustenance and livelihood in the\r\nregion.\r\n• The inhabitants of Kurinji were primarily Kurvar and Vetar.\r\n• Kurvars were a community traditionally associated with hunting and gathering, while the Vetars were\r\nknown for their expertise in honey collection and beekeeping.\r\nPair 2 is correct\r\n• Marudam was distinguished by its fertile plains, which were suitable for agriculture and cultivation.

It was widely seen in Kerala and Tamil\r\nNadu.\r\n• Characteristics of Topikal structures:\r\n Three Vertically Placed Stones: These stones are positioned upright in such a way that they form\r\nthe main structure of the topikal. They are arranged in a triangular formation, with each stone inclined\r\ninwardly at the top.\r\n Inward Inclination: The inward inclination at the top of the vertical stones suggests that the stones\r\nare not completely parallel but instead lean towards each other. This creates a stable base for the\r\ncap stone and ensures that the structure is sturdy.\r\n Plano-Convex Cap Stone: A plano-convex stone is one that is flat on one side and convex (curved\r\noutward) on the other. This cap stone is placed on top of the three vertical stones. The flat side\r\nlikely rests on the tips of the vertical stones, while the convex side faces upwards.A dolmen is a type of megalithic structure typically associated with prehistoric burial practices.\r\n• It is characterized by a large flat capstone that is placed horizontally atop two or more upright stones,\r\ncreating a chamber beneath it.\r\n• This chamber can sometimes be closed on three sides, forming a more enclosed space.\r\n• Dolmens are often found in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they were usually used as tombs or burial\r\nchambers, signifying their importance in ancient rituals and practices related to death and the afterlife.\r\n• Key characteristics of dolmens include:\r\n Capstone: A large, flat stone placed horizontally.\r\n Support Stones: Upright stones that hold up the capstone, forming the walls of the chamber.\r\n Chamber: The space beneath the capstone, sometimes enclosed on three sides,is used for burials"

It, thus, acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot. Water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability of the atmosphere."

Although subject to tidal variations, it has not been created as a result of recurrent decline in sea level. Instead, it has been shaped by the riverine system and recognised as a crucial breeding habitat for diverse species, including\r\nthe endangered saltwater crocodile.\r\n\r\nOption 2 is incorrect: Marakkanam salt pans, located in Tamil Nadu, are coastal salt marshes utilised for salt production. These pans form in coastal low-lying areas where seawater evaporates, depositing salt crystals. However, it’s essential to note that these salt pans are not a consequence of recurring decline in sea level; rather, these have been established by harnessing existing seawater resources.\r\n\r\nOption 3 is incorrect: Naupada Swamp, alternatively referred to as Naupada Wetland, is situated in Andhra Pradesh. Recurrent decreases in sea level have not shaped this freshwater swamp. Rather, it has been created by the influx of freshwater from rivers and seasonal precipitation.\r\n\r\nOption 4 is correct: The Great Rann of Kachchh comprises a unique geomorphic entity of the Indian subcontinent. It is a mysterious and fascinating tectonic landscape in an area marked by sea- level changes. Once a shallow extension of the Arabian Sea, the Rann underwent a geological transformation when a shift occurred, disconnecting it from the sea. Over time, this area evolved into a seasonal marshy salt desert. During the monsoon season, it becomes inundated with water, transforming into a wetland. In the summer months, the water recedes, leaving behind a white, salty land bed."

                  "explanation": "The Earth’s surface predominantly receives its energy in the form of short wavelengths. Short-wave solar radiation largely passes through the atmosphere without significant obstruction. The atmosphere gets heated up through the absorption of long wave radiations emitted by the earth’s surface. Water vapour acts as a strong absorber of infrared radiation. In the lower atmosphere, where water vapour concentration is relatively higher, it absorbs a notable portion of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nOption (a) is not correct: Though it is accurate that the equator receives greater direct sunlight in comparison to the poles, the disparity in insolation is not as substantial as tenfold. The variance in insolation between the equator and poles predominantly arises from the curvature of the Earth and the inclination of its axis, causing sunlight to strike different latitudes at varying angles.\r\n\r\nOption (b) is not correct: Insolation denotes the entirety of solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, encompassing a wide range of electromagnetic radiation. Although infrared radiation constitutes a substantial portion of solar radiation, it does not represent two-thirds of the insolation. Insolation comprises visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and various other wavelengths alongside infrared radiation.\r\nOption (d) is not correct: IR is not part of the visible range. infrared radiation has wavelengths longer than those of visible light and is not perceptible to the human eye."

Due to increased acidity, there is an issue of less nutrient absorption from the soil.\r\nStatement-II is correct: As the tropical rainforest lies in a region of heavy rainfall and near to tropics, thus the climate here is hot and humid. This causes the rapid decomposition of the dead organic material present in the soil.\r\nHence, statement-I is incorrect, but statement-II is correct."

The specific heat of water is greater than that of dry soil, thus, water absorbs and releases heat more slowly than land.\r\nHence, Both statement-I and statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I"

Soon, ‘chewing gum’ will be included as part of the drug delivery mechanism. Unfortunately, it has had some negative consequences. Modern chewing gum is made of non-biodegradable hydrophobic polymers together with artificial sweeteners and flavours. So, chewing this sort of synthetic material over a long time could produce some adverse effects. Each year, chewing gum generates more than 105 tonnes of “plastic” garbage. Thus, the discarded non-biodegradable residue of the gum produces plastic pollution. Every year, enormous sums of money are spent to clean up the abandoned gum from the streets. Again, it has a high potential to trap bacteria inside. Therefore, this widespread habit causes an additional nuisance in this pandemic situation.

In captivity, lions often breed every year, but in the wild, they usually breed no more than once in two years. Females are receptive to mating for three or four days within a widely variable reproductive cycle.\r\n\r\nStatement 2 is correctly matched: There are four big cats that can roar: lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar – all of which belong to the genus Panthera. In these species, the epihyal bone, part of the voice box, is replaced by a ligament. This can be stretched, creating a larger sound-producing passage and thus a wider range of pitch. The bones of the cheetah’s voice box form a fixed structure, with divided vocal cords that vibrate with both in and out breaths. This structure is the same for all the ‘small’ cats. While this design enables these cats to purr continuously, it limits the range of other sounds and prevents them from being able to roar.\r\n\r\nStatement 3 is incorrect: Leopards are known for their solitary nature and impressive hunting abilities. They are skilled predators that primarily hunt at night, using their incredible agility and stealth to catch a variety of prey. Their diet includes bugs, fish, antelope, monkeys, rodents, and more. Leopards are considered opportunistic hunters, adapting and targeting different species based on availability and their specific habitat. To avoid competition and conflicts, leopards establish their own territories, marking them with scent and claw marks on trees. Male leopards will fiercely defend their territories if they overlap with other males."

Invertebrate predators, parasites and parasitoids play an important role in keeping many animal populations under control.\r\n\r\nParasitoid is an insect whose larvae feed and develop within or on the bodies of other arthropods. Each parasitoid larva develops on a single individual and eventually kills that host. Most parasitoids are wasps, but some flies and a small number of beetles (carabid bettles), moths, lacewings, and even one caddisfly species have evolved to be parasitoids. Parasitoids alone number about 68,000 named species, and most have yet to be named and described. Realistic estimates of the total number of described and undescribed parasitoid species are about 800,000.\r\nPredator: They are organisms that captures and eats another (the prey). This act is called predation. The predatory invertebrates include scorpions, centipedes, predatory mites, predatory snails and slugs, nematodes and planarian worms\r\nDetritivores: Termites are detritivores that eat dead and decaying organic matter like logs of wood in a forest.

Thus the saplings become maintenance-free (self- sustainable) after the first three years.

Permaculture farming promotes multi-cropping and integrated farming systems. While chemical farming is more suitable for monoculture cropping due to the use of crop- specific inputs like irrigation, chemical fertiliser and harvesting methods.\r\n\r\nStatement 2 is correct: Conventional farming usually alters the natural environment, increases soil salinity, and eliminates biodiversity. Such problems are not seen in permaculture farming as it relies on organic fertilizers.\r\n\r\nStatement 3 is incorrect: Chemical farming is based on the intense use of inputs like chemical fertilizers and irrigation that make the soil less fertile over time, thus restricting its practice in semi-arid regions. Thus, conventional farming is not suitable for semi-arid regions. Permaculture involves well-designed systems that don’t produce waste and permaculture tries to imitate well-designed systems. Thus, it can work in arid climates as well.\r\n\r\nStatement 4 is correct: Mulching is an important component of Permaculture systems for promoting maximum efficiency."

In this technology, irrigation is used to evenly disperse fertiliser solutions.\r\nFertigation is practised extensively in commercial agriculture and horticulture.\r\nFertigation is used to supplement nutrients that are already present or to make up for nutrient shortages found during plant tissue\r\nIt is usually practised on high-value crops such as vegetables, turf, fruit trees, and ornamentals.\r\nStatement 1 is correct: Drip irrigation also avoids water spillage on the field which could have promoted weed growth or increased soil alkalinity due to water logging. So, fertigation also helps control weed growth and cut down alkalinity.\r\n\r\nStatement 2 is incorrect: Rock phosphate is not soluble and thus not suitable for fertigation.\r\n\r\nStatement 3 is correct: Accurate placement of nutrient, where the water goes the nutrient goes as well. Thus, increased nutrient absorption by plants.\r\n\r\nStatement 4 is correct: Reduction of fertiliser, chemicals, and water. It leads to reduction in the leaching of chemicals into the water supply."

Without proper management, these contaminants can pollute waterways, groundwater, drinking water, and the air.\r\n\r\nStatement 2 is correct: This statement is direct from NCERT Class 11 Chemistry Chapter 14 (Environmental Chemistry), Pg. 410. Burning of fossil fuels (which contain sulphur and nitrogenous matter) such as coal and oil in power stations and furnaces or petrol and diesel in motor engines produce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which leads to ‘acid rain’.\r\n\r\nStatement 3 is correct: Indian Coal has comparatively higher ash content than imported coal due to the drift theory of the formation of coal deposits in India. Coal seams formed due to drift theory contain higher ash as compared to the in-situ theory of formation"
