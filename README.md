if i go to. this page , it gives error
http://localhost:16/upsc 

and update the dashboard page as well , it have many other pages inside it , so check them out 

and on home page of the website , can we bring the choose your exam thing up ,as nobody will scroll down to see the subjects or exams 

and on the website u mentioned that we track the progress , so there is no such functionality , so need that too

and there is file called data.json where all data is stored,
I dont have much time to update the questions or data , so how to do it automatically and have the actual questions only , not the made up questions and mention the last date when they are updated.

so find something to do it.
this website is only hosted on vercel
